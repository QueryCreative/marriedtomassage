# m2m

This is the m2m repo. 

Instructions for set-up as follows:

## Getting Started

First, we'll need to be in the root directory of this repo:

	cd m2m/

We need to get all of the necessary gems before booting up the server:

	bundle install

After that, your server is good to go.  Boot it up with:

	rails s

You can now begin developing just as you would with rails views. The server is accessible on `localhost:4400` by default.
